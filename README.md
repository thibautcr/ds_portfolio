Hi there! Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. Itâ€™s a snapshot of my journey into data science, where I learn, experiment, and build step by step. I keep it updated as I take on new challenges and expand my skills. Some of the code is in French, but data speaks a universal language. Take a look, and feel free to reach out!
